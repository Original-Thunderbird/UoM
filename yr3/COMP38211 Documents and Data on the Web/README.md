        <td>ex1: WordCount</td>
        <td>ex2+3: Inverted Positional Index + tf-idf calculation</td>
    </tr>
</table>


### 1. Getting Started
Unzip dataset.rar, put txt files under input/ of each project, open Eclipse, run. Result will be in output/

A log.txt file will be generated by running cwk2 proj that records the positional index and tf-idf score. A prepared log.txt is given in this directory. 

prepare python env 
```
python -m venv mr
source mr/bin/activate
pip install nltk
```

Run validation.py, a single-thread implementation of MapReduce, to generate anoother version of log.txt, which named output.txt, to enable you to visually compare the results. 


### 2. Technologies
Java, Hadoop, python


### 3. Dataset
dataset.zip, contains 6 Bart*.txt what are extracted from wikipedia, and a stopword.txt
