For effciency:
1.initially attribute 'up' is in struct Particle, meaning that every sub-particle
is to be recorded on state up/down, which is actually meaningless. The
property is moved to struct Fire, since all particles of a firework must share 
the same status of up/down as well as saving space by removing multiple duplicate 
variables.

2.initially al particles belong to a fire are updated when the fire goes up, 
which is meaningless as their status are all the same, thus wiil help on nothing 
but consumes extra resources.
2-step optimization ca be made. The first step is to only update 1 particle of a 
fire when it goes up; thus saving computing resources. Yet during this time many 
'struct Particle's are created but not used, which is a waste of space. So the 
second step is to only create 1 particle for a fire when it goes up and rest of 
particles are created whenexplosion occurs. Hpoefuly this will help save 
considerably amount of spaces when we have a lot many firewqorks to be emitted.
currently only the first step is implemented.
