What we will do with the assessment</A>
</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Each member's total mark will be the team grade <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$G$"> multiplied by a
factor <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$A$">, which will lie between <IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$0.80$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$1.20$">. In other words,
the individual contribution can only change the group grade by plus or
minus <IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$20 \%$">. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The factor <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$A$"> is computed by averaging the peer assessments and
  the wiki and group forum contributions (as evaluated by the
  lecturers) and scaled so that less than a half share of work
  (<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.png"
 ALT="$100/(2N-1)$">) gives an <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$A$"> of <IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$0.80$"> and more than a double share
  (<IMG
 WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.png"
 ALT="$200/(N+1)$">) gives an <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$A$"> of <IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$1.20$">.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Your assessment will be kept anonymous. 

<P>

<LI>If there is a case where a student really deserves less than <IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.png"
 ALT="$80\%$">
(because they did no work, for example) please inform the lecturers. 

<P>
