    "\n",
    "1. Explain how the appropriate bit-error probability is calculated in Python for a transmission power of 1 watt.  \n",
    "    -Energy per bit(Eb) is get from 1 watt×(10^(-5))/(sampling freqency×16), where sampling frequency is 8kHz. With Eb, we can get bit-error probability(BeP) by 0.5×erfc(sqrt(Eb/(10^(-12)))).\n",
    "2. Show how the required graph of bit-error probability against Eb/No (in dB) is produced in Python.  \n",
    "    -Since Eb/N0 is not in dB, I  and transform x-axis into log scale.\n",
    "3. What is the bit-error probability when the transmission power is 1 watt?   \n",
    "    -This is the result of calculation in Q1, that's 3.86×10^(-5) approximately.\n",
    "4. Explain how the evenly distributed bit-errors are introduced.  \n",
    "    -In predefined insert_bit_errors, an array with its length equal to that of bit-array await to be altered, approximately (length of array)×(bit-error probility) number of 1's are uniformly distributed across the new array, eventually these two arrays are bitwise xor-ed together.\n",
    "5. What is the new bit-error probability (for 1.35 watts) and how was this calculated?  \n",
    "    -Energy per bit(Eb) is get from 1.35 watt×(10^(-5))/(sampling freqency×16), where sampling frequency is 8kHz. With Eb, we can get bit-error probability(BeP) by 0.5×erfc(sqrt(Eb/(10^(-12)))), that's 2.19×10^(-6) approximately.\n",
    "6. What is the PESQ score for the narrowband speech transmitted with 1.35 watts?  \n",
    "    -It's 4.29.\n",
    "7. How is the talk time affected?  \n",
    "    -Generally, the higher energy per bit, the lower the talk time; If the battery holds 18000 joules, then if we use power of 1watt, we get 18000s talk-time; for power of 1.34watt, we get 13333s.\n",
    "8. Explain in about one sentence how battery life and bit-error rates are connected.  \n",
    "    -Since higher energy per bit can avoid bit-error rate more effectively, the lower the bit-error rate, the lower the battery life."

    "    \n",
    "1. Demonstrate and comment on any improvement in the narrow-band speech quality that is obtained at the expense of the 3-fold increase in the bit-rate. How would you summarise the degree of improvement?  \n",
    "    -When bit-error rate < 10^(-3), improvement on narrow-band speech quality under 3-fold coding is obvious, I can hear almost no other sounds apart from dialogue and improvement in PESQ score is also considerable. For bit-rate larger than 10^(-3), noise gradually appear, yet audio quality is still better than that without processing under 3-fold. \n",
    "2. What is the effect of the 3-fold increase in bit-rate on the transmit power and on the energy required to transmit the speech segment?  \n",
    "    -Total bits in file remain unchanged and power per bit is stable, but as we are sending same information 3 times, energy required is also 3 times than before.\n",
    "3. If we reduce the energy per bit by a factor of 3, the transmit power becomes what it was before? Consider the example in Section 2.5 where Eb/N0 was 8.93 dB. It would now become 8.93–  10xlog10(3)=8.93-4.8 dB=4.3dB. From the msk waterfall graph above, the beP now becomes about 0.01. How well does the (3,1) rep coder work at beP=0.01?  \n",
    "    -It becomes 1/3 of previous energy. When beP=0.01, PESQ before 3-fold is 1.453, after is 1.878. Obviously it gives better result than that when 3-fold coder is not applied at all, yet there are still niticable noices, thus the result is unaccepted.\n",
    "4. What other method could be used to reduce the energy required to transmit the speech sentence without reducing the energy per bit? Think about previous Tasks.  \n",
    "    -We can reduce bit-rate(i.e. by resampling), number of bit per sample or apply Huffman coding."

    "    -It will require a retransmission. It is likely to happen often because bit-errors tend to be evenly distributed.\n",
    "2. State whether you consider ARQ as used in Part 3.4 an efficient method, and explain the reasons for your answer.  \n",
    "    -No, because we haven't take advantage of previous failed trials, and for every time we tend to have a same probability of failing without improvement, thus the method is unefficient.\n",
    "3. Explain your mechanism for combining failed retransmissions.  \n",
    "    -I will store 3 failed retransmissions and execute a ‘majority voting’ procedure. For each bit in 3 wrong string, if no less than 2 of 3 version on that bit are the same, then I believe the majority result should be the one in final result. For implementation, if we represent 3 version of current bit as b1, b2, b3, then we get result bit by calculating (b1&b2)|(b1&b3)|(b2&b3).\n",

    "    -At beP=0.03162, the new ARQ process is failing completely. There indeed are improvements, yet the result still has obvious errors.\n",
    "6. If combining failed transmissions turns out to be a good idea, why is it not used in practice, for example in wifi (you need to look this up).  \n",
